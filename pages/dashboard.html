                Looking for a new bike? There’s probably never been a better time to buy one. In the past decade, bikes
                have gotten more functional, more reliable, and more fun to ride. That’s partly because the variety has
                bloomed from a few basic styles (e.g. road, mountain, city) to now include all manner of niches and
                categories-within-categories, as bike makers diversify their offerings to appeal to the many ways that
                people enjoy riding.</p>
            <p>
                But that profusion of options presents you, the eager buyer, with a challenge:
                We sell a wide variety of bikes online. Bala Cycle Depot is there For Every Ride. How do you know which
                kind of bike is right for you and the riding you’ll do? Well, that’s what this guide is for. Use the
                handy quick-reference section up top to narrow down between broad categories, then jump down to learn
                about different options within those.

                    <p>As the name suggests, road bikes are designed to ride on the road. They absolutely can. But road
                        bikes are optimised to make road cycling as efficient as possible, and because of that they’d
                        perform terribly on a mountain dirt track.</p>

                    <p>Mountain bikes are designed to go on mountains or on off-road trails, which means they’re
                        chunkier, have knobbly tyres on them, and a frame geometry which makes them better suited for
                        seriously uneven terrain.</p>

                    <p>Also simply known as ‘Cross Bikes’, these are bikes which follow the tradition of road cyclists
                        in the olden days, who would swap their slick road tyres for knobblier tyres and continue to
                        train during the winter months.</p>
