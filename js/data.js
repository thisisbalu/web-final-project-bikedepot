The lightest disc brake road frameset we’ve ever made. The new SuperSix EVO is ready to throw down when the grade goes up. Racy geometry and stiffness for explosive speed. Better micro-suspension and big tire clearance for surprising smoothness. It all adds up to precise handling and a ride-feel that’s out of sight.",

That’s a different kind of tingly feeling, and hell, probably the reason why shuttling is even a thing. And while Specialized all for getting a hard workout in, it’s nice to have some extra power when you need it, and there’s only one bike that allows you to do that without sacrificing travel—the Turbo Kenevo Expert. With the Turbo Kenevo, you get all of the hallmarks that their trail bikes are known for—a roomy top tube for an easy fit and better control, ultra-short chainstays for nimble handling, and a low bottom bracket that makes the bike feel glued to the trail. But then you top it all off with 180 millimeters of front and rear travel, and you get a bike that’s ready to send it off of anything. Then comes an M5 aluminum frame and their hyper efficient and powerful Specialized e-MTB technology—integrating a battery and a motor that delivers 15% more power than the older versions.",
